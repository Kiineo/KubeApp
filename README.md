# Kubernetes Project README

Welcome to the Kubernetes project! This README provides an overview of the steps and components involved in setting up your Kubernetes cluster and deploying a containerized application.

## EC2 KOPS Setup

In this initial phase, we will set up the necessary infrastructure to get started with Kubernetes. This includes creating an EC2 instance to serve as the KOPS server and configuring an S3 bucket for cluster state storage.

## Kubernetes Cluster

Once the infrastructure is in place, we'll proceed to create and configure the Kubernetes cluster. This section will cover the Kubernetes definition and service files, deployment configurations for various components, and node labeling based on availability zones.

## Containerized App Deployment

With the cluster ready, we'll move on to deploying your containerized application from DockerHub. We'll specify the image location and tag to ensure your application runs smoothly.

## EBS Volume for DB Pod

To ensure data persistence for your database, we'll create and configure an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume that will be attached to your database pod.

## LABEL Node with Zones Names

We'll also label the Kubernetes nodes based on their availability zones. This node labeling is essential for optimizing resource allocation and redundancy within the cluster.

## Kubernetes Definition Files

Below are the Kubernetes definition files for your deployment, services, secrets, and volumes:

- **App-secret.yaml:** Defines a Kubernetes Secret containing sensitive data like database and RabbitMQ passwords.

- **Database Service Configuration (db-CIP.yaml):** Configures a ClusterIP service for the database.

- **Memcached Service and Deployment Configuration (mc-CIP.yaml and Mc-dep.yaml):** Configures a ClusterIP service for Memcached and defines the Memcached Deployment.

- **RabbitMQ Service and Deployment Configuration (rmq-CIP.yaml and Rmq-dep.yaml):** Configures a ClusterIP service for RabbitMQ and defines the RabbitMQ Deployment.

- **Application Service and Deployment Configuration (Vproapp-service.yaml and Vproappdep.yaml):** Configures a LoadBalancer service for the application and defines the Deployment for the containerized application.

- **Database Deployment Configuration (Vprodbdep.yaml):** Defines the Deployment for the database, including volume mounts and environment variables.

## The Final Deployment

This section will guide you through the final steps to get everything up and running within your Kubernetes cluster. It includes applying configurations, ensuring that all components are deployed correctly, and verifying the setup.

## Linking LoadBalancer with Domain

In the last step, you'll link the LoadBalancer to your domain, making your Kubernetes application accessible to external users.

Feel free to customize these configurations and instructions to suit your specific project requirements and cluster setup.

Happy Kubernetes deployment!
